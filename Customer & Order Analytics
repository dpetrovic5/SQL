#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS total_orders 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID' ;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS total 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT c.acctnum AS customer_number
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(price) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT quantity, product, sum(price * quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct c.acctnum) AS different_customer, avg(quantity*price) AS Averge_price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON f.orderID=c.order_ID
WHERE f.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
